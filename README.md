# Certificate Generation/Verification system (Vericrypt) using Blockchain
  - This website is used to generate and verify the certificate using Blockchain.
  - Using this site we can tackle problems like __Fake certificates__ and __photoshopping__ of the documents.
  - This site increases the __Authenticity__ of the certificate and determines the __originality__ of the certificate.
  - Used *Node js, React js, Ethers js, Hardhat, RemixIDE*.
  - Used **Solidity** programming language to write the smart contract.
  - Deployed the smart contract on __Polygon Blockchain__ .

**Verified smart contract on Ploygon Mumbai testnet**
