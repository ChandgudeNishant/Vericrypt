# Certificate Generation/Verification system (Vericrypt) using Blockchain

- This website is used to generate and verify the certificate using Blockchain.
- Using this site we can tackle problems like **Fake certificates** and **photoshopping** of the documents.
- This site increases the **Authenticity** of the certificate and determines the **originality** of the certificate.
- Used _Node.js, React.js, Ethers.js, Hardhat, RemixIDE_.
- Used **Solidity** programming language to write the smart contract.
- Deployed the smart contract on **Polygon Blockchain** .

**Verified smart contract on Ploygon Amoy testnet:**
